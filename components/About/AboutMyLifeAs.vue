      Web developer
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I learned about web development, including technologies such as
      <ExternalLink
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"
        >JavaScript</ExternalLink
      >
      and <ExternalLink href="https://www.php.net/docs.php">PHP</ExternalLink>,
      with the help of a friend who taught and supported me throughout the
      process. At first, I found it challenging to grasp everything, but as I
      continued to learn and work on my own projects, my understanding and skill
      grew.

    <p class="mt-4">
      I particularly enjoy using JavaScript, and had the opportunity to work
      with
      <ExternalLink href="https://beta.reactjs.org/">React</ExternalLink> and
      <ExternalLink href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html"
        >Vue</ExternalLink
      >. I also experimented with different CSS preprocessors, ultimately
      settling on using
      <ExternalLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation"
        >Tailwind CSS</ExternalLink
      >.

      Basketball player
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I have been playing basketball since the age of nine. Over the years, I
      have participated in various Slovakian Championships, earning multiple
      medals, and even had the honor of representing my country on the
      international stage, including European and
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.fiba.basketball/3x3U23WC/2022"
        >World Championship</ExternalLink
      >.

      Founder
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I founded and built a project about Slovak basketball, aiming to provide
      interesting interviews, current information, results, and statistics about
      players. The project, called
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.instagram.com/basketlab.sk/"
        >basketlab.sk</ExternalLink
      >, was successful and became popular and had thousands of fans. After
      approximately two years, the brand basketlab was abandoned and the project
      continued under the
      <ExternalLink href="https://slovakbasket.sk/sk/"
        >Slovak Basketball Association</ExternalLink
      >.

      Graphic designer
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      At the age of 13, I discovered my passion for graphic design. With years
      of experience under my belt, I've created a significant amount of outputs
      such as banners, infographics, print materials, and more, mostly for
      sports clubs and organizations. I've also had the chance to design
      complete visual concepts for events, including logos, color schemes, and
      other graphic elements. Additionally, I've had some experience in photo
      editing,
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f47nHrzYWDE"
        >video editing</ExternalLink
      >, and animation.
