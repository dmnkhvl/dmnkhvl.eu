      I'm Dominik, a web developer from Bratislava, Slovakia. I have a passion
      for technology and design, developed through years of playing basketball,
      graphic design and IT studies. My interest in web technologies really took
      off in college, where I began building more advanced web applications.

      <AboutChronicle title="Web developer">
        I learned about web development, including technologies such as
        JavaScript and PHP, with the help of a friend who taught and supported
        me throughout the process. At first, I found it challenging to grasp
        everything, but as I continued to learn and work on my own projects, my
        understanding and skill grew. I particularly enjoy using JavaScript, and
        had the opportunity to work with React and Vue. I also experimented with
        different CSS preprocessors, ultimately settling on using Tailwind CSS.
        While I am still relatively new to web development, I am excited to
        continue learning and expanding my skills.</AboutChronicle

      <AboutChronicle title="Basketball player">
        I have been playing basketball since the age of nine. Over the years, I
        have participated in various Slovakian Championships, earning multiple
        medals, and even had the honor of representing my country on the
        international stage, including European and World
        Championships.</AboutChronicle

      <AboutChronicle title="Founder">
        I founded and built a project about Slovak basketball, aiming to provide
        interesting interviews, current information, results, and statistics
        about players. The project, called basketlab.sk, was successful and
        became popular and had thousands of fans. After approximately two years,
        the brand basketlab was abandoned and the project continued under the
        Slovak Basketball Association.</AboutChronicle

      <AboutChronicle title="Graphic designer">
        At the age of 13, I discovered my passion for graphic design. With years
        of experience under my belt, I've created a significant amount of
        outputs such as banners, infographics, print materials, and more, mostly
        for sports clubs and organizations. I've also had the chance to design
        complete visual concepts for events, including logos, color schemes, and
        other graphic elements. Additionally, I've had some experience in photo
        editing, video editing, and animation.</AboutChronicle
